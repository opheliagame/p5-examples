They had to cultivate modesty, and toplessness was not a step in that direction. The sexual gaze of the patriarchal Victorian was turned towards the breast in Kerala, till then not a cause of concern. When men and women entered temples, they both took off their top cloth. Today only the men are obliged to do this. As late as the 1920s, when Namboothiri brahmin women for the first time acquired the blouse to cover themselves, purists excommunicated them for breaching custom—modesty and true moral superiority lay, they argued, in not covering up. As Aubrey Menen remarked of his grandmother's attitude to his Irish mother, it was thought that 'married women who wore blouses were Jezebels' and 'a wife who dressed herself could only be aiming at adultery'. To cover breasts because younger men demanded it was abhorrent to elders. But these elders were a minority in the face of young 'progressive' men bent on making their women 'virtuous'.\n\n[source](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52509565-the-courtesan-the-mahatma-and-the-italian-brahmin)"

But after centuries of Western colonialism that dispersed patriarchal family forms across the globe, fewer than thirty human societies remain matrilocal today. One community of Tibetan Buddhists called the Mosuo provides a fascinating example of a matrilocal society where neither spouse is expected to relocate. Among the Mosuo, grandmothers preside over large multigenerational families. Women own and inherit property through the maternal line and live with their mother’s extended family. Men live in their maternal grandmother’s household and practice a form of “walking marriage,” whereby they visit their partner only at night. Both men and women can have as many companions as they desire, without stigma, and women often do not know who has fathered their children. The concept of “father” barely exists, and men have few paternal responsibilities. Being a good uncle is far more important, as men help raise the children of their sisters. Since there is no formal marriage, the only reason men and women form pairs is because they are attracted to each other or enjoy each other’s company. When the attraction fades, romantic ties can be dissolved without negative financial consequences or social impacts on the children. How very radical the Mosuo family structure seems to many of us today highlights just how deeply ingrained our own patrilocal and patrilineal traditions remain.\n\n[source](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62919855-everyday-utopia)"
